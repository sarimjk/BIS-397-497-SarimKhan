6.17 (PROJECT: COOKING WITH HEALTHIER INGREDIENTS) In the “Strings: A Deeper
 Look” chapter’s exercises, you’ll write a script that enables its user to 
 enter ingredients from a cooking recipe, then recommends healthier 
 replacements. In preparation for that exercise, create a dictionary that 
 maps ingredients to lists of potential replacements. Some ingredient 
 replacements are shown below:


An example of a dictionary of ingredients and their substitutions includes
 pairs such as 1 cup of sour cream and 1 cup yogurt, 1 teaspoon lemon juice
 and 1 half teaspoon vinegar, and 1 cup butter and 1 cup margarine or yogurt.
Your dictionary should take into consideration that replacements are not 
always one-for-one. For example, if a cake recipe calls for three eggs, 
it might reasonably use six egg whites instead. Research conversion data
 for measurements and ingredient substitutes online. Your dictionary should
 map the ingredients to lists of potential substitutes.
